# About

This is the code for my blog. It's a customization of the [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) theme for Jekyll.  
Feel free to fork, change, modify and re-use it.

## How to use it

Clone this repository, and then run `rake` to run the server.  
There is a rake task to create new posts:

```bash
rake post title="my new post"
```
