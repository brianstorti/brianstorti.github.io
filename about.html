      Hi, there! My name is <strong>Brian Thomas Storti</strong>, and this is my face:
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/images/profile.png" class="rounded-corner-img" />

    <p>
      I've worked with small companies, I've worked with huge companies, and I
      even created my own company some years ago, but now I'm a consultant and
      developer at <strong><a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a></strong>, where I
      work with smart people, solving interesting problems, which is pretty cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm currently living in Porto Alegre, Brazil, but working mostly with clients in the US.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've worked with a bunch of different technologies already, but the ones I'm more active now are <code>Ruby</code>, <code>Java</code> and <code>JavaScript</code>
      I'm also starting to write some really bad <code>Clojure</code> code on my spare time.
    </p>
