    <p>
      I've worked with small companies, I've worked with huge companies, and I
      even created my own company some years ago, but now I'm a developer at <strong><a href="http://engineering.alphasights.com">AlphaSights</a></strong>, where I
      work with smart people, solving interesting problems, which is pretty cool. Pior to that I was working at <strong><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've experienced a bunch of different technologies already, but the ones
      I'm more active now are <code>Ruby</code>, <code>Java</code> and <code>Elixir</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also believe that the only way to indent code is with spaces, so if you use tabs, please stop.
