      Hi, there! I'm <strong>Brian Storti</strong>, and I like to create things with code.
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/images/profile-big.png" class="rounded-corner-img" />

    <p>
      I've worked with small companies, I've worked with huge companies, and I
      even created my own company some years ago, but now I'm a consultant and
      developer at <strong><a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a></strong>, where I
      work with smart people, solving interesting problems, which is pretty cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've experienced a bunch of different technologies already, but the ones
      I'm more active now are <code>Ruby</code>, <code>Java</code> and <code>JavaScript</code>.
      I'm also starting to write some really bad <code>Clojure</code> in my spare time, hoping that
      it will get better soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also believe that the only way to indent code is with spaces, so if you use tabs, please stop.
