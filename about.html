    <p>
      My name is Brian Storti, I am a developer and consultant living in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Porto+Alegre&source=lnms&tbm=isch">Brazil</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My job is to solve companies' problems, and I really like when that involves writing code. I've been doing this for about 10 years, more recently for <a href="http://engineering.alphasights.com">AlphaSights</a>
      and <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm interested in a couple of different things, but I'm particularly fascinated about the challenges involved in creating reliable Distributed Systems.

    <p>
      Last but not least, I believe the only way to indent code is using spaces, so if you are still using tabs, please stop.

      This is how I look in a business card:

    And this is how I look eating <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=p%C3%A3o+de+queijo&espv=2&biw=1916&bih=983&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi6o8LfyLfRAhXEEJAKHSuNDToQ_AUIBigB">cheese bread</a> on a Sunday morning (a lot happier):
